# The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

## Introduction

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-a-leadership-fable-20th-anniversary-edition-patrick-m-lencioni/2980473?ean=9780787960759) provides insight on ways in which behaviours within a team can prevent success.

_I read this book around October 2023_.

## TL;DR

* Teamwork is the ultimate competitive advantage. Above all other factors, finance, strategy, tech, it is the most important.
* People are imperfect, so teams are inherently dysfunctional.
* The 5 dysfunctions of a team are:
    * **Absence of trust** - Unnwillingness to be vulnerable
    * **Fear of conflict** - Maintaining artificial harmony
    * **Lack of commitment** - Feinging of agreement with no intention to follow through
    * **Avoidance of accountability** - Lack of constructive challenge on meeting of agreements leading to low standards
    * **Inattention to results** - Focus on individual results rather than collective success of peer group team.

### My Commentary

* **Good Basic Principles** - The 5 dysfunctions are a good primer to assess the effectiveness of your team, and can help identify opportunities for improving the performance of your team. _They flavours of these in many other leadership / team management books._
* **Assumed At Will Employment** - The book, as do many written by American authors, makes assumptions about the ease of replacing staff. The realitiy is that if you have a dysfunctional team member it is often not as quick as suggested to make a change, which has side effects not contemplated by the book.

## The Dysfunctions

### Absence of trust

* Team Building / Ice Breakers
    * Exercise A
        * Answer 5 questions
            * Hometown
            * Number of kids in family
            * Interesting childhood hobbies
            * Biggest challenge growing up
            * First job
        * What your life was like as a child, but not interested in your inner child. It’s not a therapy session
    * Exercise B
        * Individual Ideation - 5m
            * Single biggest strength
            * Single biggest weakness
        * Share with group - Xm

* Trust is not the same as assuming everyone is on the same page, or that they don’t need to be pushed. Trust is when a team member pushes you, that they’re doing to because they care about the team.
    * Push with respect, assume positive intent
    * Doesn't work if there's not buy-in or alignment on the team/organisational goals

### Fear of conflict

* Description: lack of constructive conflict, reached via people holding back rather than constantly working through issues and cycling through conflict
* Examples
    * Deferring decisions. e.g. half and half, not agreement on next steps

### Lack of commitment

* Description: where there isn’t collective buy in to a proposal/plan. 
* Conflict important because it enables people to feel listened to, if not they won’t get onboard
* Doesn’t mean everyone agrees, but give opportunity to make a case against, and if disagreement then explain why so they understand if not agree with the rationale.
* Does not mean consensus, rare. This just becomes an attempt to please everyone, which in turn displeases everyone
* Disagree and commit

### Avoidance of accountability

* Description: when you avoid giving feedback to others, particularly peers, because your avoiding the interpersonal discomfort
* Hard, but as important to challenge peers. Why can it be difficult:
    * If they’re helpful
    * If they get defensive
    * If they are intimidating

### Inattention to results

* Description: team members seeking out individual recognition/attention at expense of collective (team/company) results/goals
* Method: 
    * Collective goals should be simple enough to grasp easily, and specific enough to be actionable.
    * E.g. profit isn’t actionable, should be more closely related to what individuals do on a daily basis.
* Loyalties and confidentialities
    * Is your first team your DRs or your peer group?
* It needs to be your peer group, if you’re to adhere to focusing on team rather than independent results/goals
        * A more complicated idea in matrix orgs, which product engineering focused companies tend to be

## Quotes

> “Politics is when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they really think.”

## Other Ideas

### Meeting Discipline

* Everyone should have full attention
* If the topic strays into information only relevant to a subset of the team, and should be taken offline, call it out rather than disengaging.
* A meeting without conflict isn’t worth having… if it’s not engaging everyone it’s failed. They should be an interactive affair. Is this true?
